One wading a Fall meadow finds on all sides 11
The Queen Anne's Lace lying like lilies 9 
On water; it glides 5
So from the walker, it turns 7
Dry grass to a lake, as the slightest shade of you
Valleys my mind in fabulous blue Lucernes.
 
The beautiful changes as a forest is changed
By a chameleon's tuning his skin to it;
As a mantis, arranged
On a green leaf, grows
Into it, makes the leaf leafier, and proves
Any greenness is deeper than anyone knows.

Your hands hold roses always in a way that says
They are not only yours; the beautiful changes
In such kind ways,
Wishing ever to sunder
Things and things' selves for a second finding, to lose
For a moment all that it touches back to wonder.
